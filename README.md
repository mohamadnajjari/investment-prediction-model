# investment-prediction-model
This project focuses on predicting investment returns using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from 'investment_data.csv', is preprocessed and then used to train a RandomForestClassifier model. Feature importance is analyzed, and a Logistic Regression model is trained on the selected features to predict investment returns.
# Libraries Used:
pandas (import pandas as pd): For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy (import numpy as np): For numerical operations and array manipulation.
scikit-learn (from sklearn...): For machine learning tasks, including model training, feature scaling, and evaluation.
seaborn (import seaborn as sns): For data visualization.
matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt): For creating plots and charts.
# Steps:
## 1. Data Loading and Initial Visualization:
Load the dataset from 'investment_data.csv'.
Visualize the initial scatter plot of the investment returns.
## 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Identify and handle missing values in the 'Returns' column.
Standardize numeric features using StandardScaler.
One-hot encode categorical features.
## 3.Model Training:
Train a RandomForestClassifier to assess feature importances.
## 4.Feature Importance Analysis:
Analyze feature importances and select significant features.
## 5.Logistic Regression Modeling:
Train a Logistic Regression model on the selected features.
Evaluate the model on a test set.
## 6.Feature Importance Visualization:
Visualize feature importances using a bar chart.
# Usage:
## 1. Ensure the 'investment_data.csv' file is available in the project directory.
## 2. Execute the provided Python script to load, preprocess, train models, and visualize results.
# Notes:
The RandomForestClassifier is initially used to gauge feature importances.
A Logistic Regression model is then trained on the selected features for investment returns prediction.
# Acknowledgments:
This project is a simple example of predicting investment returns for educational purposes and may require further refinement for real-world applications.
