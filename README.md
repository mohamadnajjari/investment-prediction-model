# investment-prediction-model
This project focuses on predicting investment returns using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from 'investment_data.csv', is preprocessed and then used to train a RandomForestClassifier model. Feature importance is analyzed, and a Logistic Regression model is trained on the selected features to predict investment returns.
